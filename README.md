# Coral Collection

Fragments of *Montipora capitata* (one per colony) were collected on 15 June 2016 from the fringing reefs of Kaneohe Bay, Oahu, Hawaii (21.429748, -157.793024) under SAP 2017-28. They were immediately returned to the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology where they were placed in a 1,300L common garden tank with flowing seawater (Putnam et al 2016 Evol App). Coral nubbins were formed by attaching the broken skeleton to plastic frag plugs using non toxic hot glue. Nubbins were acclimated for 15 days under ambient environmetnal conditions including natural diurnal fluctuations in pH, light, and temperature (e.g., Putnam et al 2016 Evol App).

# Treatment Conditions

Three treatments conditions were created to look at the individual effects of increased temperature and pCO2 on coral response. These included Ambient Temperature, Ambient CO2 (ATAC), Ambient Temperature, High CO2  (ATHC), and High Temperature, Ambient CO2  (HTAC). Each treatment was replicated in three tanks, with 6 replicate nubbins in each tank (one per original collection colony) for the experimental time series. Nubbins were collected at 06:30 on 30 June 2016 for Time0, 07:30 for 1 hour of exposure, and 12:30 for six hours of exposure.

# Coral Sampling

Coral nubbins were placed in sterile whirlpacks and snap frozen at the following times
